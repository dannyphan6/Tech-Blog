## Project Description
Writing about tech is just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codes. Along with that, developers also spend a majority of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. You may ask yourself, well where does all this get documented? Tech-Blog is a great place to start! Tech-Blog allows developers to create an account, sign in, and create/edit/remove posts. Developers are able to keep up-to-date on tech that's constantly evolving. 

Below is an example that shows the application's appearance and functionality:

## Installation
Before running the application, the user must execute the command "npm install" to install all of the required dependencies. You're all set once all dependencies are installed!

## Usage
In order to run this application locally, run the command "npm start" in the terminal. This will execute the application where the user will be able to create, view, update, and delete posts, as long as they're signed in. The home page is where all posts, along with their comments will be displayed. If the user would like to edit the post, then they will have to navigate to 'Dashboard' where each post will be displayed. From there, click on the single post and it'll navigate to a different page, where the user can either edit or delete the post.
